# Progress

One entry per phase, with the checks that gated it and the output they produced.
Phases follow Section 16 of `docs/BUILD_SPECIFICATION.md`.

## Toolchain as installed

Recorded at Phase 0 and verified, not assumed. Where the installed version
differs from the floor the specification names, the substitution and its reason
are given.

| Component | Specification floor | Installed | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| OS | Windows 11 Pro, WSL2 Ubuntu | Windows 11 Pro 10.0.26200, Ubuntu 26.04 LTS, kernel 6.18.33.2 | as specified |
| CPU | i7-14700K, 8 P plus 12 E, 28 threads | i7-14700K, 28 logical processors visible in guest | guest sees a synthesised uniform topology, see ENV-04 |
| RAM | 32 GB, about 10 GB free | 31.7 GB host, 12 GB budgeted to WSL, 10 GB free in guest | `.wslconfig` predates this project and carries a documented crash history |
| GPU | RTX 5070 12 GB, sm_120 | RTX 5070, 12227 MiB, compute capability 12.0, driver 610.62 | as specified |
| Host compiler | GCC 16.1 | GCC 16.0.1 20260322 experimental | 16.1 is not released; 16.0.1 is the newest packaged 16. Chosen over the stable GCC 15.2 on merit: it provides `<mdspan>`, which 15.2 lacks, and reports OpenMP 5.2 against 15.2's 4.5 |
| C++ standard | C++23 | `__cplusplus` 202302 | as specified |
| CMake | 4.4 | 4.4.0 via pipx | distribution ships 4.2.3, which is below the floor |
| MPI | OpenMPI 5.0.x | OpenMPI 5.0.10 | advertises MPI 3.1, implements MPI 4 entry points, see ENV-03 |
| OpenMP | 6.0 cited | GCC reports `_OPENMP` 202111, which is OpenMP 5.2 | 6.0 constructs are not used; the restriction is deliberate and asserted at compile time |
| CUDA | 13.3 | 13.3, V13.3.73 | host compiler forced to g++-14, see ENV-01 |
| CUDA host compiler | not specified | GCC 14 | nvcc 13.3 rejects GCC above 15 and miscompiles GCC 15 headers |
| Python | 3 with matplotlib, pandas | 3.14.4, matplotlib 3.10.7, pandas 2.3.3, PyYAML, tqdm | as specified |
| LaTeX | TeX Live with latexmk | latexmk 4.87 | as specified |
| Other | | ninja 1.13.2, clang-format 20.1.7, ruff 0.15.22, poppler-utils | |

### Deliberate deviations from the specification

1. **WSL processor count.** Section 3 asks for `processors=20` in `.wslconfig`.
   The file already sets `processors=28`, exposing every host logical processor,
   which is a superset of what the scaling sweep to 20 workers needs. It also
   carries a dated comment explaining that a lower count makes the hybrid core
   comparison impossible to measure, and documents a machine crash the memory
   budget in the same file exists to prevent. Left alone, deliberately.

2. **Compiler.** GCC 16.0.1 rather than 16.1, because 16.1 does not exist yet.
   See the table above for why 16 was preferred to the stable 15.2 regardless.

3. **OpenMP level.** The 6.0 specification is cited as the reference document, as
   asked, but GCC implements to 5.2 and the code is restricted to that. The build
   asserts `_OPENMP >= 201511` so a downgraded toolchain fails loudly.

---

## Phase 0: toolchain, repository, dash lint

Done.

- Every version above verified by running the tool, not by reading a package
  list. Four environment findings recorded as ENV-01 to ENV-04 in the
  engineering log; two of them changed the build's structure.
- `scripts/check_no_dashes.py` written and self tested. It covers the two banned
  characters, eight visually identical stand ins, the LaTeX `--` and `---`
  ligatures in prose only, and compiled PDFs through `pdftotext`. It correctly
  ignores `%` comments, `\url`, `\verb`, `verbatim` and `lstlisting`.
- Its first run found an em dash in the build specification itself (STYLE-01).
- Repository skeleton, MIT licence, `.clang-format`, `.gitignore`, and
  `.claude/settings.local.json` with attribution disabled before the first
  commit.

Gate: `check_no_dashes.py` reports the tree clean, and the linter's own self
test passes.

## Phase 1: numerics core and the serial solver zoo

Done.

- Numerics: bisection, Newton, Brent; adaptive Simpson, Gauss Legendre with
  nodes computed rather than tabulated, Romberg; RK4 and adaptive Dormand
  Prince 5(4); dense LU with partial pivoting, Householder QR, and the Thomas
  algorithm.
- Twelve solvers behind one interface: Richardson, Jacobi, forward, backward,
  symmetric and red black Gauss Seidel, SOR, SSOR, red black SOR, block Jacobi,
  block Gauss Seidel, and conjugate gradient. The nine of Objective 1 plus the
  three red black variants the GPU comparison needs.
- Two problem families: the 2D Poisson five point stencil with closed form
  theory, and seeded dense systems in diagonally dominant and symmetric positive
  definite flavours.
- Every result carries value, error estimate, iteration count, evaluation count,
  converged flag and an explicit stop reason.

Gate: 22 unit assertions across `test_numerics` and `test_solvers` pass,
including every solver on a hand checkable 4 by 4 system and on a 15 by 15
Poisson problem.

Findings: NUM-02 and NUM-03, both real divergence bugs in Richardson, and
NUM-04, the measured rounding floor of stationary iteration.

## Phase 2: convergence and theory ratios

Done. Thirteen assertions, each comparing a measurement against a closed form
prediction rather than a previous run.

Measured on the 2D Poisson model problem:

| Claim | Theory | Measured |
|---|---|---|
| Jacobi contraction factor | cos(pi h) | matches to 1e-3 relative at n = 31 and 63 |
| Jacobi to Gauss Seidel iteration ratio | 2, from rho_GS = rho_J^2 | 2.00 within 2 percent |
| Forward against backward Gauss Seidel | equal rates on a symmetric operator | equal within 1 percent |
| SOR at Young's omega* = 2 / (1 + sin(pi h)) | a minimum | beats every perturbation of plus or minus 0.02 and 0.05 |
| Jacobi iteration count growth, grid doubled | O(n^2), factor about 4 | greater than 3 |
| Optimal SOR growth, grid doubled | O(n), factor about 2 | less than 2.6 |
| Red black against natural ordering Gauss Seidel | small penalty | ratio in [0.95, 1.3] |
| Line Jacobi to line Gauss Seidel | 2 | 2.00 within 0.15 |
| Conjugate gradient growth, grid doubled | O(n) from kappa = O(h^-2) | 41 to 93 iterations, factor 2.27 |
| RK4 global error order | 4 | 4.00 within 0.15 |
| Composite Simpson order | 4 | 4.00 within 0.15 |
| Five point stencil order | 2 | 2.00 within 0.1 |
| Discretisation error constant | pi^2 / 12 = 0.8225 | 0.823 |

Finding: NUM-01. The manufactured solution is an exact eigenvector of the
stencil, which makes conjugate gradient terminate in one iteration at every grid
size. Both right hand sides are now provided and each is used where it is
honest. A test now asserts the one iteration behaviour so the trap stays
recorded.

## Phase 3: shared memory backends and equivalence

Done. OpenMP, POSIX threads and a `std::jthread` pool, each idiomatic
underneath a common interface of `parallel_for`, `reduce`, `barrier` and an
ordered pass.

The equivalence gate is asserted in its strong form: with the deterministic
reduction mode, every backend at every worker count produces **bit identical**
iterates, not merely close ones. That is possible because the reduction chunk
grid depends on the problem size alone and never on the worker count, so
partials are always combined in the same order.

Gate: `test_equivalence` passes, covering every applicable solver on both the
Poisson and dense problems, across serial, OpenMP, pthreads and jthread, at 1,
2, 3, 4, 7, 8 and 16 workers, plus static against dynamic scheduling, plus the
remainder aware partition over 6 sizes and 33 part counts.

Finding: CONC-01, a destructor ordering hazard in the jthread pool, found by
inspection and fixed before it could reproduce.
